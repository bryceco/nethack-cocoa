# Introduction #

Requirements (older versions might or might not work):

  * Xcode 3.2.1
  * Mac OS X 10.6.2

# Details #

After extraction you should be able to load the xcode project (at the root of the project) and build. The trunk is completely bootstrapped for a 32-bit version. 64-bit would require some changes.
